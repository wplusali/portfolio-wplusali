# Portfolio-wplusali

Welcome to my Portfolio Project using HTML and CSS. This project represents the culmination of everything I've learned in the first two weeks of my coding journey. It's designed using Grid Layouts and Nested Grid Layouts, with a strong focus on responsiveness, making it a flexible and dynamic showcase of my skills.

## Description

The objective of this project was to implement and consolidate my knowledge of HTML and CSS, particularly in the areas of Grid Layouts. This portfolio serves as the foundational basis for my professional showcase, allowing me to continuously expand and update it as my skills and experiences grow. Through this project, I've gained in-depth knowledge about grid layouts and practical application of HTML and CSS.
